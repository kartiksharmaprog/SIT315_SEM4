## System Architecture

### a) Pin Change Interrupt (PCINT0_vect)

- Monitors D8 and D9
- Handles PIR motion detection
- Handles push button press/release
- Both inputs are part of Port B (D8–D13 group)

### b) External Interrupt (INT0)

- Connected to ultrasonic ECHO pin (D2)
- Configured in CHANGE mode
- Measures pulse duration using `micros()`
- Calculates distance

### c) Timer1 Interrupt

- Configured in CTC mode
- 1024 prescaler
- OCR1A = 15624 (1 second interval)
- Toggles heartbeat LED
- Triggers ultrasonic measurement
- Logs uptime in Serial Monitor

---

## Design Principles

- ISRs are minimal and flag-based only
- No delay() inside any ISR
- All processing occurs in the main loop
- Shared variables declared `volatile`
- Clear separation of:
  - Event-driven logic (PCI + External Interrupt)
  - Time-driven logic (Timer1)

This ensures low interrupt latency and reliable concurrent execution.

## Sense–Think–Act Flow

**Sense:**
- PIR detects motion
- Button detects user input
- Ultrasonic measures object distance

**Think:**
- Evaluate motion state
- Evaluate button state
- Check if distance < 20cm
- Track system uptime

**Act:**
- Turn LEDs ON/OFF accordingly
- Toggle heartbeat LED
- Display detailed interrupt events in Serial Monitor

## Serial Monitor Output Example

```
=== Interrupt Driven System Started ===
[TIMER] 1 Second Tick → Uptime: 1
[PCI] PIR Motion Detected → LED_PIR ON
[PCI] Button Pressed → LED_BUTTON ON
[EXT INT] Distance Measured: 14.2 cm
[ULTRA] Object Close → LED_DISTANCE ON
```

---

## Testing Scenarios

1. Trigger PIR motion sensor  
   → PCI event detected  
   → Motion LED activated  

2. Press and release push button  
   → PCI event detected  
   → Button LED toggled  

3. Place object within 20cm of ultrasonic sensor  
   → External interrupt measures distance  
   → Distance LED activated  

4. Observe heartbeat LED blinking every second  
   → Timer interrupt verified
